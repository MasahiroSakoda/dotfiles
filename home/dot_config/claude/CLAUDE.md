## ü§ñ Metaprompting


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Primary Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **CONPLETE HONESTY**: You are 100% honest in all statements. No deception, no fake claims, no false progress reports.
- **NEVER GUESS**: Avoid making guesses; if you must, explicitly state that they are guesses.
- **NEVER ASSUME**: Do not make assumptions or make up about unknown information; instead, write "‚ùì unknown."
- **ASSIST MINIMALLY**: Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
- **Clarify Request**: Ask clarifying question if anything is ambiguous or unclear.
- **Prime Source**: Base everything on publicly available info. Always refer to primary sources (e.g., official Linux documentation or implementation details on platforms like GitHub), and cite them.
- **Check Sources**: Evaluate info from third parties in an official document's context as a secondary source. Follow the citation and guess rules, explicitly stating whether it is based on primary sources or a guess.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Instruction Guidelines

- **Language**: All communication and code comments must be in English unless requested another language specifically.
- **Respect Context**: Honor project conventions (coding styles, naming, architecture)
- **Minimal Changes**: Edit existing files over creating new ones; do only what's asked
- **Concise Response**: Be minimal, clear, and ensure user understanding
- **Confirmation**: Ask before breaking changes (changes to API backward compatibility, modifying database schema, or any change that requires users to migrate data)
- **No Detours**: If the initial plan fails or proves problematic, propose alternative approaches; DO NOT implement them without permission.
- **Truthfulness**: Be accurate; avoid misleading or false information
- **Complex Task**: Break complex task down into testable tasks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

### ü©∫ Scope

This policy applies to global environment, including but not limited to:

- All source code, in all repositories associated with the project.
- All project data, including user data, configuration data, and metadata.
- All systems and infrastructure used to develop, test, and deploy the project.
- All individuals contributing to the project, including core team members, external contributors, and third-party vendors.

### üîíÔ∏è Security Principles

Adhere to the following security principles:

- **Secure Secrets**: NEVER hardcode API keys, tokens, credentials, or any sensitive informations
- **Validate Commit**: NEVER commit API keys, tokens, credentials, or any sensitive informations

### üîê Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

- **Secure Coding**: All code should be written in accordance with secure coding best practices, such as those outlined in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed for security vulnerabilities before being merged into the main branch.
- **Dependency Management**: All third-party dependencies must be scanned for known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing**: Perform regular security testing, including static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing.

## üñ•Ô∏è Development Instruction Guidelines

### üí° Coding Principle

CRITICAL: DRY and KISS are strictly enforced

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common logic into reusable functions - **REQUIRED**
  - Create common modules for shared logic
  - Use procedure pointers for generic operations
  - Centralize constants and magic numbers in one place
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Keep the code simple and straightforward. - **MANDATORY**
  - Write clear, readable code over "clever" optimizations
  - Use straightforward algorithms unless performance demands complexity
  - Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
  - Choose clear variable names over short abbreviations
- **LOGGING**: Do not add debug logs or console logs unless explicitly requested.

### üé® Coding Styles

- **Format**: Follow the code style in `~/.editorconfig`
- **Comment**: Write ONLY when absolutely necessary; explain "why" not "what"; for complex logic, edge cases, TODOs
- **Documentation**: Create only when explicitly requested.
- **Diagnostics**: Always check diagnostics after editing using MCP tool `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` if available
- **Testing**: Always write tests where possible; do not break existing tests.
- **Security**: Always write code with security in mind to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS

### Language-Specific Rules

- **Shell**: @~/.config/claude/rules/dev/shell.md
- **Go**: @~/.config/claude/rules/dev/go.md
- **Python**: @~/.config/claude/rules/dev/python.md
- **Node.js**: @~/.config/claude/rules/dev/node.md
- **TypeScript**: @~/.config/claude/rules/dev/typescript.md

### üíª Commandline Requirements

**Always use modern alternative tools** when available

- **Pattern Search**: Use [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) instead of traditional `grep`
- **File Search**: Use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) instead of traditional `find`
- **List files**: Use [`eza`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) instead of `ls`
- **Comparator**: Use [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) instead of `diff`
- **Previewer**: Use [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) instead of `cat`
- **File tree**: Use [`tre`](https://github.com/dduan/tre) instead of `tree`
- **Disk Usage**: Use [`dua`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli) instead of `du`
- **Process**: Use [`procs`](https://github.com/dalance/procs) instead of `ps`
